## Hello there! <img style="height: 32px;" src="https://blog.joypixels.com/content/images/2019/06/waving_hand_sign_1024.gif"/>

#### I'm Francisco (he/they), a 20 year old student learning software development.

I'm a programmer with a passion for Typescript and full-stack development. Some of my notable projects include "speaq", a full-stack chat app built with React, Next.js, Prisma, Express.js and Socket.IO.

In addition to Typescript, I am also knowledgeable in Java and Kotlin. I enjoy using Kotlin for its functional programming capabilities and have used it to develop a few Android apps.

Feel free to check out my repositories and contact me with any questions and opportunities (whether it be employment or just friendly collaboration) :)
