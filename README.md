## Hello there! <img style="height: 32px;" src="https://blog.joypixels.com/content/images/2019/06/waving_hand_sign_1024.gif"/>

#### I'm Francisco (he/they), a 19 year old student learning software development.

I'm interested in learning front-end technologies like React, Next.js and Vue, as well as backend tools such as Node; I've already built a number of fullstack web applications using Express as well as TRPC with Next.js.

I have also worked with relational database management systems, such as PostgreSQL and MySQL.

I have experience writing code in Typescript, Java and Kotlin, and have built a number of Android applications using Kotlin. I'm passionate about learning new technologies and improving my skills.
