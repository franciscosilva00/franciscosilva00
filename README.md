# âœ¨ Hi there!

#### My name is Francisco (he/they), I'm a 19 year old student learning software development.

I'm currently working on a full-stack project to finish my high school course - <b>speaq</b> - which you can find [here](https://github.com/franciscosilva00/speaq_electron). It's based on Vue, Electron and Express.js.

I'm mostly focused on learning front-end technologies such as **Vue.js**, **React**, **web development** in general and **Android**.
